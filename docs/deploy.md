# Deployment Instructions

1. Merge development changes into master.
   1. If merging from `development` branch, use a merge commit, do not squash or rebase.
   2. If done on github, pull changes to local development environment before proceeding.
2. Remove or comment out `/dist` line from .gitignore, this will allow us to include our build results into source control.
3. Run `npm run build` from terminal
   1. NOTE: build assets should now be in `/dist` folder.
   2. if any errors, ensure you have node installed and run `npm install` to install esbuild
4. IMPORTANT: DO NOT STAGE AND COMMIT CHANGES TO .GITIGNORE FILE! We don't want to include our build results normally.
5. stage and commit contents of `/dist` folder. DO NOT STAGE AND COMMIT CHANGES TO .GITIGNORE!
